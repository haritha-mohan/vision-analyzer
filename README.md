# vision-analyzer

This is a .NET macos app that uses some of the latest API added as part of the Xcode 15 updates to the Vision framework (note this is different from VisionOS, read more [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision?language=objc)).

The functionality of the sample is contingent upon this PR: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/pull/19412

To successfully use the sample pre-release, please make sure you are using the SDK version from that branch's build (and update your nuget config!).
